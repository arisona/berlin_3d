# Esri CityEngine project with detailed 3D building models of Berlin Mitte

This project contains a Esri CityEngine model with ground plane, streets, parcels and 3D models of Berlin Mitte (2x2km)
based on the open data provided by Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung und Wohnen (https://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/)

According to the copyright of the source data (see link below) you may use and modify this project 
as you like, but commercial use is prohibited.

The CityEngine project was originally used for an participatory urban planning application "Enabling DEMO:POLIS" at the Berlin Academy of Arts in 2016. The source code for the application is available freely as well (see https://robotized.arisona.ch/enabling-demopolis/ for more information).
